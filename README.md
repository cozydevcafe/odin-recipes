Odin recipe website

This is the HTML project for The Odin Project

I learned the following:

- Structuring a website
- Commiting changes to a repository and uploading them to github
- Using alt tags in images to describe them
- When to use different heading to layout page content
- When to use ordered and unordered lists

Items learned as I've progressed through The Odin Project

- Basic CSS fundamentals
- Learning about the behavior of block and inline element to add some style to the homepage of this site
